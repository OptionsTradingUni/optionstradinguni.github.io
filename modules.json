    "title": "Module 1: Introduction to Options",
    "content": "Options trading gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price. Unlike stocks, which represent direct ownership, options represent contracts with defined expiration and risk. In this first module we’ll explore how options work, their history, and why traders use them. We’ll discuss leverage, hedging, speculation, and how options can fit into a broader portfolio. This introduction sets the foundation for everything else in the course."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 2: Calls vs. Puts",
    "content": "Calls and puts are the building blocks of options trading. A call gives the right to buy the underlying, while a put gives the right to sell. In practice, traders use calls when bullish, and puts when bearish or hedging. This module breaks down simple scenarios—like betting on a stock rally with calls or protecting a portfolio with puts. You’ll also see how buying and selling each type can create vastly different outcomes."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 3: Understanding Premiums",
    "content": "Premium is the cost of the option, influenced by intrinsic value (how far in-the-money it is) and extrinsic value (time + volatility). Premiums change as expiration approaches, and volatility spikes can make options expensive. In this module we’ll explore how premiums are priced, why weekly options are cheaper than monthlies, and how implied volatility crush can wipe out option value after earnings."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 4: The Greeks Explained",
    "content": "The Greeks—Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho—measure risk and sensitivity. Delta tracks how much the option moves with the stock. Gamma shows how Delta itself changes. Theta represents time decay, the silent cost of holding options. Vega tracks volatility’s impact, and Rho measures interest rates. While intimidating, understanding these will separate you from gamblers. Examples with real option chains make this module practical."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 5: Risk Management Fundamentals",
    "content": "Risk management is more important than strategy. Here we emphasize position sizing, stop-losses, and risk/reward ratios. Many beginners blow accounts because they risk 50% or 100% on one trade. We’ll walk through calculating max risk on a trade, setting stop-losses, and the psychology of cutting losers quickly while letting winners grow."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 6: Expiration and Assignment",
    "content": "Every option expires. Traders must know what happens if a contract is left to expiration—automatic exercise, assignment risk, or total premium loss. This module covers weekly vs. monthly expirations, American vs. European exercise styles, and how brokers handle assignments. We also explain how to avoid unwanted assignment by closing before expiration."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 7: Break-Even Analysis",

We’ll walk through several examples, showing why knowing break-even helps set realistic expectations and avoid emotional exits."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 8: Covered Calls",
    "content": "Covered calls are a conservative strategy for stockholders. By selling calls against shares you own, you earn premium income. This module explains how to choose strikes, manage assignment risk, and use covered calls to generate steady cash flow. A practical case study with Apple stock demonstrates the strategy in action."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 9: Protective Puts",
    "content": "A protective put acts like insurance for a stock position. Traders pay a premium to buy downside protection, just like insurance on a car. This module shows when protective puts make sense, how to choose strike levels, and how they reduce portfolio drawdowns during market crashes."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 10: Vertical Spreads",
    "content": "Vertical spreads limit risk and cap reward. By buying one option and selling another, traders can control cost. We’ll explain bull call spreads, bear put spreads, and credit spreads, with examples of risk graphs. You’ll learn when to deploy each and how to manage them as expiration nears."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 11: Debit vs. Credit Spreads",
    "content": "Debit spreads require upfront cost, credit spreads generate income upfront. This module compares the two, showing how credit spreads can profit even if the market goes sideways, while debit spreads are better for directional conviction. We’ll break down max profit, max loss, and probability of profit."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 12: Iron Condors",
    "content": "Iron condors are a non-directional strategy where traders sell both a call spread and a put spread. This creates a profit zone if the stock stays within a range. This module shows how iron condors generate income from time decay and volatility crush, but also the risks if the stock makes a large move."
  },
  {
    "title": "Module 13: Straddles and Strangles",
    "content": "Straddles and strangles profit from volatility. By buying both calls and puts, traders benefit from big moves in either direction.

  },
  {
    "title": "Module 14: Probability and Statistics",
